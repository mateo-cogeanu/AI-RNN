# Simple RNN Chatbot

## Overview

This project implements a simple Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) for text generation and interaction. The RNN is designed to take a single character as input and generate text in response, allowing for an interactive chat-like experience.

## Features

- Character-based text generation
- Interactive mode for chatting with the RNN
- Simple architecture with input, hidden, and output layers

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- NumPy

## Installation

1. Clone the repository or download the code files.
2. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.
3. Install the required dependencies, if not already installed:

   ```bash
   pip install numpy
